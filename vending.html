					<p class = "statement_txt">I made a bubbly UI in Figma that easily encapsulated all the functions of a vending machine. I made sure to have bright colors, and large buttons to accomodate the touchscreen.</p>

				<p>In the Lo-Fi prototype I mainly focused on experminting with different buttons and sections shapes. As I said before, I really wanted to make sure that the button I would use whould limit misclicks.</p>

				<h2 class="stage">Final Iteration</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Once I had mostly figures out the layout and the Lo-FI prototype, I began to move into the HI-Fi Prototye. In the Hi-Fi prototype I changed around the typeface, some of the spacing, the color, and the effects. To get the fun bubbly effect I layered different typefaces. I chose the typeface I did because it had the right mix of the roundness and the boldness that I wanted.</p>
