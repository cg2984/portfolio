				<h2 class="stage">First Draft</h2>
				<hr>
				<p> I began my sketches in Adobe Illustrator. I worked in black and white because I wanted to make sure that the logo made sense in any medium, like black and white printing. I thought that the "&" might be an interesting part of the logo so I included it in a few of the versions, but I also made sure to include some with just the acronym.</p>

				<hr>
				<p>I got feedback on the other logos, and then submitted my final version. My final iterations was between italicized and non italicized text. I chose non-italicized because I felt that it was easier to read, and fit with the acronym.</p>
