					<h2 class="statement_dec">PROBLEM:</h2>
					<p class = "statement_txt"> Design a logo for a brick and mortar STEM toy store that is expanding into the digital zone. The website has to have the community feel that the owner gets from the brick and mortart store, as well as a way for the buyers to get a real-life sense of the toy that they are buying.</p>
					<h2 class = "statement_dec"> SOLUTION:</h2>
					<p class = "statement_txt"> A well tested prototype that keeps elements of the original toys store by including a digital 3D view of the toy. </p>

			<h2 class="stage">Brainstorming and Background Research</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>In this stage we began to plan out the issues that we would face for the project. The main purpose would be to sell STEM toys, so we decided those visting would be buying toys for children. But, they wouldn't necessarily be the parents of the children, so they might not know exactly what they wanted from the toy store.</p>
			<p> We also brainstormed the categorization of the toys. STEM was a logical first step since the toys are in those categories already. However, we considered the terms 'science', 'tech', 'engineering', and 'math' might be confusing for shoppers. What is the main difference between tech and engineering for someone who is buying a toy? To solve this problem we went to a real toy store and observed how the toys were categorized there. While at the toy store, we were also able to interview a toy store employee, and get a sense of the questions that are commonly asked in a toy store.</p>

			<h2 class ="stage">Sketching the Website</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>With our baseline research done, we began to sketch out how the website would look. Our initial sketches were on paper to move quickly through ideating designs and ideas.</p>1

				<h2 class="stage">User Testing</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>To begin the User Testing we did some card sorting to test out our categories. I gave the testers a stack of cards with types of toys written on them, and asked the testers to put them in the category that made the most sense. This was to ensure that the way we sorted the toys makes sense to the users, and to ensure that when they use the webstie they will be able to find everything that they need.</p>
				<p>There was also in-person user testing. This process was invaluble because we were able to give the users a directive, and observe the steps that they took to complete it. We were also able to ask questions when the users lingered in a specific area, and learn why they lingered there.</p>

			<h2 class="stage">User Journeys</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>Throughout the process we were always consiering the steps that a user would take to get to the most critical parts of the website. After all, we didn't want an important part of the website, like the contact page, to be buried beneath layers of UI. PArt of the finialization process was making sure that the journies for each of our user personas made sense and weren't too convoluted.</p>
