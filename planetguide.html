				<hr>
				<p>
					How can we ensure that the public in the future are able to access the data found from new planets? My solution is an app that records each new planet being disovered in an app that the public can browse. The app features the ability to search for planets by characteristic and location, to browse planets by name and by proximity to your location, and to save the planets that you find interesting.

				<h2 class="stage">Brainstorming and Sketching</h2>
				<hr>
				<p> In this stage I began to sketch my ideas on paper and in Illustrator. I wanted to play with a broad range of brandmarks and typography. At this stage I was experimenting with golf visual elements, and Martian visual elements. The smiley face comes from Galle's Crater, which is a crater on Mars that looks like a face. This is also the where I got the idea for the name.</p>

			<h2 class ="stage">Lo-Fi Prototype</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>The Lo-Fi stage was a way for me to just focus on the layout. It also enables me to test interactions between different pages in my app.</p>

				<h2 class="stage">Stylesheet</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Before I started on the Hi-Fi prototype I began to think about the color and icons of my app. I used moodboards and iteration to figure out my color scheme. I was either going to go with a blue and white clean futuristic theme, or a purple and black holographic theme. In the end I went with the white and blue clean theme. I also worked on making the buttons and typefaces. I choose the header because it was futuristic with the dot. I chose Quicksand becase I liked the roundess of it.</p>

				<h2 class="stage">Hi-Fi Prototype: Version 1</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>In the high-fi prototype I was trying to apply the elements and colors that I had decided on in my stylesheet. Initially, I applied the white and blue color scheme. Eventually, however, I  realized that I wanted a darker purple palette because it had the retro, holographic theme that had the fun element I wanted in this app.</p>

				<h2 class="stage">User Testing: Round 1</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>I stitched together my styling and lo-fi prototypes to test my layout because I needed to ensure my layout was usable before getting to deep into the styling. I didn’t want to spend weeks on styling only to realize that the layout behind it was incomprehensible, and I would have to make new elements to fix it. I found that I needed to change a lot of the buttons I had placed because they were outside of the users lin of sight. I also found out that my uisers often felt they didn't know where they were because I didn't have enough headers.</p>

				<h2 class="stage">User Testing: Round 2</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>During this round of tests, I wanted to make sure that the changes I made based on the last round of tests were actually helpful. There were two main changes. The first, making dedicated headers for each section so that the users is never lost. This proved to be very helpful in teh saved planets section. In my previous tests, users did not understand they were in the saved planets section until I explained to them, but during this round they were immediatley able to get it. Second, I changed the the call to action on the first page. Rather than having three seperate buttons for each section I hmade the planet search feature the main call to action, and put the other two sections in a menu. I also wanted to ensure that the icons I had made for the planets and the writing changes I had made were helpful.</p>

				<h2 class="stage">Final App</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>This stage was all about finalizing details, like visualizations for a planet's atmosphere. I also decided to add a few features after I made a couple user journeys. First, I added a comparison feature because I thoiught my users would like to see planets similar to the ones that they find when they are browsing for planets alphabetically. Second, a search by location feature, because users might just want an overview of the planets in a specific area that they are not near. Lastly, overlays that display information about planets that are selected since in the "Browse planets alphabetically" section the user might be overwhelmed by the amount of planets that are seemingly identical.</p>

				<h2 class="stage">Stylesheet</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>The final version of the stylesheet has all of the final colors and gradients, the text styling, the base elements, the completed elements, and the spacing between elements. I had a bit of trouble figuring out how exactly to make sections, but I landed on horzontal lines becasue I could easily group together alternate stylings.</p>
